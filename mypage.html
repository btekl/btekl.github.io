    <h1>Teklits, Brian</h1>
    <p>
        I was born in New York (State not City) but have lived in Colorado since I was five. I commute 40 miles each way to campus,
        driving about halfway then taking a few busses to campus. I'm an applied math major minoring in Computer Science. For me, Computer
        Science is both a creative outlet and (hopefully) a way to earn a living. I enjoy the way a challenging problem is able to pull 
        me into "the zone": when you focus so intently on something you don't notice anything else around you. I am an avid Eagles fan:
        the picture below is my favorite sports moment.
